"""An LLM provider behind a thin interface: `generate(messages, schema) -> dict`.

It is thin not for beauty's sake: changing the provider or moving to a local
model must not disturb the rest of the code. All the application knows about
the model is that it takes a list of messages and returns an object matching a
schema.

There is no network in the tests and there must not be: the interview and the
parsing of an answer are checked against recorded model answers, and
`RecordedProvider` is not a stub "so it compiles" but a full implementation of
the same interface.
