"""An organization's daily LLM token budget.

The organization brings the key, and the organization pays for it. Without a
budget one member — or one scenario stuck in a loop — burns the key's monthly
limit in an evening, and the key's owner learns about it from the invoice. The
product's budget is a fuse on top of the provider's limits, not a replacement
for them.

It is counted by UTC calendar days. The day boundary in someone else's timezone
is not the kind of precision worth dragging the organization's timezone into
the counter for: the fuse works the same whatever the offset of the day
boundary.
