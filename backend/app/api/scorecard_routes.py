"""Routes of a project's scorecard.

Its own file by the same rule as the proposal: the scorecard has its own domain
layer (app/scorecard) and its own character of writing — snapshots and metric
configs live outside the revision journal; the only thing that goes through the
mutation layer is the task created by the "red two weeks running" rule, and the
domain does that itself.

Reading is for anyone who can see the project, and it has a side effect: the
first GET after a week boundary appends the weekly snapshots (lazy commitment —
see app.scorecard). Writing (recalculation, metric configuration) requires
write access to the project.
