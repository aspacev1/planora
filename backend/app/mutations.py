# a map of what was shifted into the journal, and the inverse gets it back through
# this field and lays the dates out verbatim, computing nothing.
#
# The same technique as SetProgress.status: the coupling runs in the forward
# operation while the inverse takes the finished result. Recomputing the automatic
# shift on an undo is impossible in principle — "move to the earliest possible" is
# irreversible: a forward move remembers where it came from, a computation of it
# does not.

    It lives in the mutation layer rather than in the route for exactly the reason
    the specification calls the rule one and the same regardless of the means of
    input: dragging with the mouse, editing a field on a card and applying a batch
    from AI all arrive here by one road, while in the route there would be three of
    them.

    The check runs before application: there is no intermediate "moved but not
    explained" state in the system, and none must come about even for the duration
    of one transaction.

    An undo deliberately goes through the same check. It is not a privileged
    action: if returning to a previous value takes a task further from the baseline
    plan than the threshold, an explanation is needed exactly as it is for any other
    way of getting there.

    Tasks moved by the automatic shift are not counted here, and that is a decision
    rather than an omission. The threshold asks "explain what you are doing", while
    an automatic shift is not what a person does but a consequence of dependencies
    they set up earlier: they move one task, and the chain follows it by a rule they
    themselves turned on. Asking for a reason once more for every link of the chain
    would mean asking one and the same question as many times as there are
    dependencies. The links' own deviation is not hidden meanwhile: the badge on the
    bar and the "the plan has diverged from what was agreed" flag are computed from
    the dates and show them, whoever moved those dates.

    The check runs before application while the forward computation of the shift
    runs during it, so there is nothing here to compute the future chain with short
    of repeating the whole computation in a second pass. That is a second argument
    for the same decision, but not the first: were the computation free, the answer
    would be the same.

    """Rolling a whole batch back — the one AI applied with a single button.

    The order is reversed: a batch creates a category and then the tasks in it, and
    a rollback from the beginning would run into a non-empty category.

    Revisions already undone are skipped: pressing the same button again is not an
    order to apply the inverse operation a second time. Undos themselves are not
    undone either — for the same reason `last_undoable` goes around them; there is
    no un-rollback ("bring the batch back") in the first version.

    The undos get a shared batch_id of their own: in the journal a batch rollback
    reads as one action rather than as a scattering of unrelated entries.

    A reason is accepted and handed to every undo: a rollback goes through the same
    threshold check as any change of dates, and without a reason a batch that moved
    dates further than the threshold would be un-rollbackable altogether.
