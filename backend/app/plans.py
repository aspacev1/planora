    """A task's deviation from its baseline plan, in days.

    ``None`` means the task has no baseline: it was created after approval and
    is exempt from explanations — adding work is normal, hiding a schedule shift
    is not.

    It is measured against the baseline plan, not against the previous value.
    That is not an implementation detail but the rule itself: measured against
    the previous value, a task is moved five times by one day, ends up a week
    away in total, and not a single explanation is left in its history.

    A shift of the start is measured in calendar days while duration is measured
    in working days, because that is the unit duration is given in. Mixing units
    is deliberate: "we pushed it by a week" is something a person says about the
    calendar, while "it got two days longer" is about the work, and neither of
    the two questions becomes clearer when answered in the other's units.

    The dimensions are not mixed: the dimension named is the one measured. Pass
    ``start_date`` and only the shift of the start is computed; pass
    ``duration_days`` and only the duration is. Otherwise a task whose dates
    have already moved past the threshold with an explanation would demand a
    reason for every one-day edit of its duration — and vice versa; the
    X-Shift-Deviation-Days header would then name a number from the other
    dimension. With no arguments, the greater of the two current deviations is
    returned — the answer to "how far has the task drifted from what was
    promised".
