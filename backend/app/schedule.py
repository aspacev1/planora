"""The relative plan and its anchoring to a calendar start date.

A relative plan is not tied to real dates: tasks have an offset from the
project's beginning in working days, a duration and dependencies, while the
scale reads as "Month 1 / Week 1 / Day 1". The offset, however, is stored not in
a column of its own but in that same `Task.start_date` — as a coordinate on the
relative axis:

    day N of the project  =  RELATIVE_EPOCH + (N - 1) calendar days.

RELATIVE_EPOCH is a Monday, so "Week 1" starts on a Monday and the working-week
mask lands on the relative axis without corrections. Holidays are deliberately
not applied in relative mode: a holiday is a property of a real date, which the
plan does not have yet, and a relative project's calendar consists of a single
weekly mask (see relative_calendar).

Why a coordinate rather than a column with an offset: an offset and a coordinate
are in one-to-one correspondence for a fixed mask, but a coordinate is already
what the revision journal, undo, the shift threshold, the plan snapshots and the
entire client speak in. A second column with the same content would be a second
representation of one and the same thing — and would one day diverge from the
first.

Anchoring to a start date moves the plan into calendar mode with no drift: every
task's coordinate is read as an offset in working days from the epoch, and that
same offset is laid off from the assigned start along the real calendar — with
weekends and holidays. The source of truth, both before and after, is the start
plus durations plus dependencies plus the working calendar, not the finish date.
