"""A project's scorecard: a weekly panel of the plan's health.

How it works, in brief. The metrics are computed from the live plan (the task
tables; proposals not yet carried across live separately and do not reach this)
and from the revision journal. A week is an ISO week in the project's timezone
(inherited from the organization), and days are working days everywhere —
through the project's calendar.

The architecture deliberately has no scheduler, so committing weeks is lazy: the
first GET after a week boundary appends the missing weekly snapshots and
recomputes the current week. Snapshots of past weeks are immutable — they are a
chronicle, and streaks and the sparkline are computed from them; only the current
week's row is overwritten, and it doubles as a five-minute cache of the live
computation. Journal-based metrics (`date_shifts`, `close_rate`, `scope_growth`)
are reconstructed exactly for missed weeks; state cross-sections cannot be
reconstructed — they are computed from the current state as of the end of that
week and marked `backfilled: true` in details.

`finish_drift` — the shift of the projected finish over a week — is computed as
the difference between two neighbouring snapshots, so missed weeks have no point
of reference: they are written as `no_data`+`backfilled` rather than
reconstructed by replaying the journal (that is a separate task, out of
proportion to the benefit). The very first week with no previous snapshot is
`no_data` too: drift with no base is unmeasurable rather than equal to zero.

The "red two weeks running" rule fires when the current week's snapshot is
written: a "Investigate: {metric}" task is created through the mutation layer,
and a `rule_triggered` event remains as a trace. Repetition is suppressed until
the streak breaks — by the events already recorded rather than by a separate
flag: the event is itself the memory that a task has been created for this streak.
